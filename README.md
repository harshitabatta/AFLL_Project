Title: Python AFLL Project: Parsing and Identifying Data Structures from Input String

Description:

In the Advanced Fundamentals of Language and Logic (AFLL) project for the 3rd semester, we aim to develop a Python program capable of parsing input strings and identifying whether they represent a dictionary, list, tuple, or set. This project integrates principles of programming, and parsing, providing an opportunity to explore various concepts learned in the course
